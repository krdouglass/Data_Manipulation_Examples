# Data Manipulation Examples
The purpose of this R script is to demonstrate useful functions from the 
dplyr package I often use to manipulate and summarize data. 
This was made mostly for my own reference and a way to practice
these functions so it is far from perfect or comprehensive, but I will 
share it for others who may find it helpful.
